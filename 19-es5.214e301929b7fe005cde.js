There are two major categories of xenobiotic metabolic reactions, namely, Phase I and Phase II metabolism (Meyer, 1996, Rodeiro et al., 2008). Phase I metabolism usually occurs during drug absorption in the gut wall or in the liver before these drugs reach the systemic circulation. It consists of a set of reactions which convert the parent hydrophobic drug to a more polar metabolite through oxidation, reduction, or hydroxylation (Yan and Caldwell, 2001).   Xenobiotics that are retained in the circulation after undergoing Phase I metabolism will be further metabolized in Phase II metabolism, of which the parent drug or its metabolite formed in Phase I is conjugated with an endogenous substrate. Generally, the hepatic and extrahepatic CYP450 enzymes are important for the majority of Phase I reactions.\n      </p>\n      <p class="info-para">\n        The cytochrome P450 monooxygenase system is responsible for the biotransformation of both endogenous and exogenous compounds. CYP1, 2, and 3 are the first three families of human cytochrome P450 responsible for a majority of xenobiotic metabolism, while the other families are mainly involved in the endogenous metabolism (Ding and Kaminsky, 2003, Pelkonen and Raunio, 1997, Zhang et al., 2006). At least twelve isozymes, namely, CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP1B1, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 are responsible for the biotransformation of more than 90% of marketed drugs (Bertz and Granneman, 1997, Pelkonen et al., 2008, Peng et al., 2003, Testino and Patonay, 2003). The most abundant expressed CYP3A4 is involved in approximately 50% to 60% of the total drug metabolism (Frye, 2004, Leucuta and Vlase, 2006, Shord et al., 2009). Many of these xenobiotics are substrates for CYP3A4, for example,  statins such as atorvastatin (Lipitor\xae) and simvastatin (Zocor\xae) (Wang et al., 1991), the immune suppressant cyclosporine (Kronbach et al., 1988), protease inhibitors such as indinavir (Koudriakova et al., 1998), and sildenafil (Viagra\xae) (Warrington et al., 2000).\n      </p>\n      '},{imgUrl:"assets/img/info-2.jpg",title:"Drug-Drug Interactions (DDI) and Drug-Herb Interactions (DHI) and the Risks of Adverse Drug Reactions",content:'\n      <p class="info-para">\n        Drug interactions have been a major reason for hospitalization and even fatality (Lazarou et al., 1998). These interactions occur when the pharmacokinetics or the pharmacodynamics of a therapeutic agent is altered due to the administration of herb/nutraceutical/food or a concomitant drug (Leucuta and Vlase, 2006). The absorption, distribution, metabolism, or elimination (ADME) of a drug in the human body may be affected by drug interactions, so does the pharmacological/therapeutic effects of a drug (Leucuta and Vlase, 2006, Dresser and Bailey, 2002). Inhibition of cytochrome P450 enzymatic activities due to the presence of an inhibitor, is the most common mechanism underlying drug interactions that has led to the decrease in metabolic enzyme activity (Naritomi et al., 2004, Walsky and Obach, 2004). Inhibition of enzyme activity may result in higher concentrations and/or prolonged half-life of the substrate drug in the human body, thus enhancing the potential for toxic side effects (Bachmann and Lewis, 2005). For example, inhibitors of CYP1A2 such as ciprofloxacin, cimetidine, and SSRI fluvoxamine, can excessively increase the concentration of theophylline in plasma, leading to cardiac arrhythmias and seizures (Niki et al., 1987, Sperber, 1991, Wijnands et al., 1986).\n      </p>\n      <p class="info-para">\n        Cytochrome P450 enzyme induction-mediated interaction is another factor affecting drug biotransformation (Boobis et al., 2009, Ogu and Maxa, 2000). Nuclear receptors such as pregnane X receptor (PXR), constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and vitamin D receptor (VDR) are involved in regulating CYP2B, CYP2C and CYP3A genes, respectively  and are believed to play a major role in the transcriptional mechanism of cytochrome P450 induction (Lin, 2006, Pascussi et al., 2003, Pelkonen et al., 2008, Yamada et al., 2006). The formation of either hetero- or homodimer of these nuclear receptors increases the gene transcription and ultimately, speeds up the catalytic activity of the cytochrome P450 (Perlmann et al., 1996). The increased cytochrome P450 enzymatic activity due to induction of cytochrome P450 results in poor drug efficacy and loss of the desired pharmacological effect (Lin, 2006, Yan and Caldwell, 2001).\n      </p>\n      <p class="info-para">\n        A variety of interactions of herbs or foods with drugs have been well documented. Recent reports showed that a majority of the world population has used one or more complementary and alternatives medicines for maintaining health and for the treatment of diseases (MacLennan et al., 2002, Ni et al., 2002, Taylor et al., 2004). However, these herbal medicines may contain phytochemicals which are capable of inhibiting or inducing drug-metabolizing enzymes.  A typical and well-known example of drug-herb interaction (DHI) is the herbal antidepressant, St. John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum L). It modulates the CYP3A4 catalytic activity which leads to a decrease in plasma drug concentration (Gibson et al., 2002, Lucey et al., 1990, Mannel, 2004). St John\u2019s wort is found to cause significant reductions in plasma concentration of indinavir (Piscitelli et al., 2000), cyclosporine (Ruschitzka et al., 2000, Karliova et al., 2000, Breidenbach et al., 2000), amitryptiline (Johne et al., 2002) and imatinib mesylate (Frye et al., 2004). Most of these drugs have narrow therapeutic index and a slight change of the plasma drug concentration would be detrimental to the patients.\n      </p>\n      <p class="info-para">\n        As part of the regulatory requirements, interactions between an investigational new drug and other drugs must be defined during drug development. This is in view that preliminary screening would be highly appropriate in reducing and eliminating the possibility of these drugs failing in pre-clinical or clinical development stages. The main objectives of DDI studies are to determine whether potential interactions between investigational drug or new chemical entity (NCE) and other drugs exist and, if so, whether the potential for such interactions indicates a need for dosage adjustments, additional therapeutic monitoring, a contraindication to concomitant use, or other measures to mitigate risk (Food and Drug Administration (FDA), 2020). These criteria and requirements are mandatory for new investigational drugs but are not applicable to the development of nutraceuticals or herbal-based traditional products. Preparations registered under \u201ctraditional or complementary products\u201d in Malaysia do not require mandatory drug-herb interaction safety data. However, the availability of DHI data would likely be beneficial for product labelling.\n      </p>\n      '},{imgUrl:"assets/img/info-3.jpg",title:"DDI and DHI studies",content:'\n      <p class="info-para">\n        The study of DDI for a new drug generally begins with in vitro studies to determine whether a drug is a substrate, inhibitor, or inducer of metabolizing enzymes. The results of in vitro studies will determine the nature and extent of in vivo studies that may be required to assess potential interactions. Coupled with clinical pharmacokinetic data, results from in vitro studies may serve as a screening mechanism to rule out the need for additional in vivo studies or provide a mechanistic basis for proper design of clinical studies using a modelling and simulation approach. Utilizing in vitro tools to determine whether a drug is a substrate, inhibitor, or inducer of metabolizing enzymes, followed by in vivo interaction studies to assess potential interactions, has become an integral part of drug development and regulatory review (Food and Drug Administration (FDA), 2020). Even though herbal-based or traditional products do not require strict requirements prior to product registration as compared with drug entities, the safety of these alternative medicine should not be taken lightly. As such, more publications recently focused on the natural products and their effects on cytochrome P450 metabolism and risks of possible drug interactions. In addition to the in vitro cytochrome P450 inhibition and induction studies, greater emphasis has been given to the evaluation of NCEs as potential substrate or inhibitor of the P-glycoprotein, hepatic and renal uptake transporters such as Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) or OATP1B3 and/or Organic Anion Transporter 1 (OAT1), OAT3 or Organic Cation Transporter 2 (OCT2).\n      </p>\n      <p class="info-para">\n        P glycoprotein (P-gp) is one of the drug efflux transporters that play an important role in pharmacokinetics of drugs or xenobiotics. P-gp is a multidrug transporter and one of the members of the ABC (ATP-binding cassette) superfamily encoded by the MDR-1 gene in human (Hennessy and Spiers, 2007). P-gp protects the cells from any xenobiotics and toxins by pumping out them from the cells before being excrete out from the body. The efflux of the drug helps in preventing it from reaching the systemic circulation (Vaalburg et al., 2005). P-gp is the most intensively studied among all the ABC transporters as it has an ability to transport wide range of drugs and compounds making it the most important protein to be studied in drug-protein interaction (Gadhe et al., 2011). Many drugs and compound had been found to be a substrate of P-gp and some of these compounds cause DHI by inducing or inhibiting this protein. For example, administration of ciprofloxacin and digoxin concomitantly had been found to cause DDI mediated by P-gp (Moffett et al., 2013). Regular intake of Siberian ginseng (Eleutherococcus senticocus) is found to increase the bioavailability of digoxin, a substrate of P-glycoprotein (Fugh-Berman, 2000).\n      </p>\n      <p class="info-para">\n        Other transporter systems implicated in DDI and DHIs include the uptake transporters. These transporters actively pump drugs into cells such as hepatocytes and renal tubular cells. Drugs can then be secreted into the bile, metabolized (hepatocyte) or secreted into the urine (renal tubular cell). Uptake transporters are divided into those that transport anionic molecules (organic anion transporters [OATs] or organic anion transporting polypeptides [OATPs]) and those that transport cationic molecules (organic cation transporters [OCTs]). Examples of OAT substrates include methotrexate and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). These drugs are secreted by the renal tubular cells as their primary method of elimination. When two drugs which are substrates for the same OAT are co-administered, there is a possibility for competitive inhibition, and hence, alteration of drug elimination may occur. Numerous reports have described an interaction between NSAIDs and methotrexate that can result in severe methotrexate toxicity, a direct result of NSAID competing for OATs and reducing the renal clearance of methotrexate (Maeda et al., 2008). Several flavonoids found in Chinese herbal medicine were also identified as potent inhibitors and/or substrates of human OAT1 and may have high potential for drug interactions in combination therapy and alter the active tubular secretion of the drugs (Lin et al., 2012, Wang and Sweet, 2013). Bidirectional transport assay and uptake transport assays in overexpressed cell lines are preferred methods for in vitro evaluation of drug interaction involving transporters.\n      </p>\n      <p class="info-para">\n        Drug-drug interaction (DDI) studies are important preclinical studies in the drug development process. Evaluation of drug interaction risks on chemical entities or pure compounds is straight forward. However, the same is not applicable for finished botanical or herbal products, simply because these preparations usually consist of a mixture of components or exist in crude forms. The presence of multiple bioactive plant compounds further complicates the establishment of product safety margins. Herbal products are usually marketed in pharmaceutical-like unit dosage form such as tablets, capsules, powders or drops. Thus, a greater challenge would be to extract the likely bioavailable cohort of active components from these dosage forms for subsequent testing in different models, especially cell culture systems. This is important to ensure only active components are exposed to the testing models as the presence of other inert excipients may cause osmotic changes in the cell culture systems.\n      </p>\n      <p class="info-para">\n        Herbal products are an important part of the health food market and are widely used by the world population especially in the developing countries for primary health care needs. These products are generally perceived to be safe and devoid of toxic effects, hence many users prefer natural medicine instead of synthetic remedies. However, the number of reports on unwanted side effects of natural products has increased over the last years. In some instances, concurrent use of herbal medicines with allopathic drugs especially among people with chronic disease predisposes them to severe adverse reactions and toxicity due to drug-herb interactions (DHIs). Existing regulatory safety criteria such as screening for heavy metal and adulterants alone are certainly insufficient to ensure consumer safety. Finished herbal medicine products are currently lacking in safety labelling and precautions. Doctors, pharmacists and other health care professionals have difficulties trying to educate the public on the safe use of botanical medicines as there is lack of relevant data.\n      </p>\n      '},{imgUrl:"assets/img/info-4.jpg",title:"Herbal Products and Adverse Drug Reactions",content:'\n      <p class="info-para">\n        Among the traditional medicine practices, herbal medicines are the most popular and used by the general population around the globe. Herbal medicines have been widely utilized as remedies for the prevention and treatment of multiple health conditions for centuries by almost every known culture. The sales of botanical medicines are booming and represent a substantial proportion of the global drug market (Pal and Shukla, 2003, Ekor, 2013, Bandaranayake, 2006, WHO, 2005b). Technavio\u2019s analysts forecasted the global herbal supplements market to grow at a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 6.29% during the period 2016-2020 (https://www.technavio.com/report/global-health-and-wellness-herbal-supplements-market). According to a WHO report, approximately 70-80% of the world population especially in developing countries relies on traditional medicine, mostly plant drugs for their primary health care needs (WHO, 2002).\n      </p>\n      <p class="info-para">\n        Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are ranked the fourth and seventh leading cause of death in the USA and Sweden, respectively (Kiguba et al., 2017, Jemal et al., 2005). Seminal research undertaken in the late 20th and early 21st century in the USA and the UK demonstrated that ADRs are a common manifestation in clinical practice, an important cause of unscheduled hospital admissions, occurring during hospital admission and manifesting after discharge (Coleman and Pontefract, 2016). ADR as a result of drug-drug, drug-herb and drug-food interactions are a growing concern in the health care setting. Drug interaction refers to an adverse drug response produced by the administration of a drug or co-exposure of the drug with another substance which modifies the patient\u2019s response to the drug (European Medicines Agency, 2012).  All these interactions may produce either antagonistic, synergistic, additive pharmacological effect or toxicity to patients. Although drug interactions are considered to be preventable, studies revealed that up to 11% of patients experience symptoms associated with drug-drug interactions (DDIs) (Juurlink et al., 2003). DDIs  are responsible for up to 2-3% of hospital admissions (Tragni et al., 2013, Miranda et al., 2011, Grymonpre et al., 1988) and are associated with increased health care use (Shad et al., 2001, McDonnell and Jacobs, 2002). In the United States, the economic burden of medication-related morbidity and mortality is as high as $177 billion (Ernst and Grizzle, 2001).\n      </p>\n      <p class="info-para">\n        Several serious problems have been reported with the steady global increase in botanical medicine use. Herbal medicine interaction with conventional drugs  may result in inadequate dosing of drugs and adverse reactions from minor to severe and toxicity (Enioutina et al., 2017). Quite commonly, older adult populations are more likely to use both conventional drug therapy and herbal medicines as this population is likely to have a higher incidence of chronic disease. As such, the potential for herb-disease and herb-drug interactions increases with older adult populations. At present, research evaluating the use of botanical medicines, especially clinical trials are lacking. In a global survey initiated with WHO, the main difficulties regarding regulatory issues for botanical medicines faced by member countries are lack of research data and appropriate mechanisms for control use (WHO, 2005a). In many countries, including the U.S., herbal medicines are not regulated as extensively as conventional drug therapy. It is also common knowledge that the safety of most herbal products is further compromised by lack of suitable quality controls, inadequate labelling, and the absence of appropriate patient information (Raynor et al., 2011). There is certainly a need for the necessary research efforts to study both efficacy and safety of herbal medicines, both alone and in conjunction with conventional drug therapies.
